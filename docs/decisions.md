# Decisions Log

This file records project-level decisions the team has explicitly approved.
CLAUDE.md remains the primary source of truth for the project. If a decision
recorded here changes a rule currently written in CLAUDE.md, that conflict is
called out below, and CLAUDE.md should be updated deliberately by the team —
not silently overridden by this log.

## 2026-08-24 — RAG scope for Phase 0 and Phase 1

**Decision:** Nidhi (RBI Compliance / Rule Engine / RAG) may implement a
small, explicitly-scoped RAG smoke test during Phase 0 (continuing as-is into
Phase 1): download one real RBI source document, chunk a portion of it,
embed and index those chunks in ChromaDB, and run one test retrieval query
to confirm real, correctly-attributed text comes back.

**Scope limit:** This is a proof-of-concept only — it is NOT full RAG
integration. It must not be expanded into a multi-document corpus,
production-grade retrieval, or embedding/chunking strategy tuning without
explicit team approval. Full RAG pipeline integration remains Phase 3 work.

**Why:** RAG is one of the more novel and uncertain parts of the stack for a
beginner team. Proving early that a real RBI document can be chunked,
embedded, and retrieved correctly de-risks Phase 3 without pulling Phase 3
scope forward.

**Status:** Approved (recorded from project kickoff instructions, 2026-08-24).

## 2026-08-24 — Git branching model: per-task branches

**Decision:** Team members create a new short-lived branch per task, not one
long-lived branch per person. Branch naming: `feature/<name>-<short-task>`.

Examples:

- `feature/namitha-dataset-preprocessing`
- `feature/manas-shap-wrapper`
- `feature/arushi-fairness-metrics`
- `feature/nidhi-rag-smoketest`
- `feature/khushi-streamlit-skeleton`

**Why:** Small, task-scoped branches keep pull requests small and make
merges/conflicts easier to reason about for a team new to Git. A single
long-lived branch per person tends to accumulate unrelated changes, grow
stale, and produce large, hard-to-review PRs with tangled conflicts.

**Conflict flagged (resolved 2026-08-25):** CLAUDE.md section 8 ("Git /
GitHub Workflow") previously recommended one branch per person
(`feature/namitha`, `feature/manas`, `feature/arushi`, `feature/nidhi`,
`feature/khushi`). This decision superseded that recommendation for actual
day-to-day work. Per explicit team instruction on 2026-08-25, CLAUDE.md
section 8 has now been updated to describe the per-task branching model
(`feature/<name>-<short-task>`) instead. See also docs/git-workflow.md and
docs/team-workflow.md for the full step-by-step process.

**Status:** Approved (recorded from project kickoff instructions, 2026-08-24).
CLAUDE.md section 8 updated to match on 2026-08-25.

## 2026-08-25 — Module interface sign-off for Phase 1

**Decision:** The team reviewed `docs/module-interfaces.md` and approved
the draft interfaces for Phase 1, with two additive changes:

- **Namitha (Model/Data):** approved as-is, no changes to the shared dict.
  Clarification: the shared dict does not carry the trained model object
  itself. In Phase 1, the model artifact is expected to be accessed via
  `app/models/model.py`'s `save()`/`load()` (path-based), called directly
  by the explainability module within the same process — not passed
  through the shared interface dict.
- **Manas (Explainability):** approved as-is, no new fields. Feature
  context comes from `model_metadata.feature_names`.
- **Arushi (Fairness/Drift):** approved with two additive fields —
  `fairness_report()` gains `protected_attribute`; `drift_report()` gains
  `features_evaluated`. The actual protected attribute depends on the
  Phase 1 dataset choice, still open (see `docs/TASK.md` §14).
- **Nidhi (RBI Compliance):** approved as-is. No RAG-specific fields added
  now; `evidence_chunks` stays empty until Phase 3.
- **Khushi (API/Dashboard):** approved as-is. The API exposes module
  outputs under `model` / `explainability` / `fairness_drift` /
  `compliance` without reshaping or flattening them.

**Why:** Locks in the shared data contracts before Phase 1 real-logic work
starts, so modules built in parallel don't diverge on field names/shapes.

**Status:** Approved (team interface sign-off, 2026-08-25). See
`docs/module-interfaces.md` for the full current shapes and
`docs/TASK.md` §14 (now checked off) for the original open item. Phase 0
stubs for `app/fairness/fairness.py` and `app/drift/drift.py` were updated
to include the two new additive fields so the documented interface and the
actual Phase 0 stub output stay consistent; their tests were updated to
match.
